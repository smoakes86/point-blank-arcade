# DALL-E Sprite Generation Guide for Point Blank Arcade

This document contains optimized DALL-E 3 prompts for generating all game sprites.
Use these prompts with DALL-E 3 or ChatGPT with DALL-E integration.

## Best Practices for Game Sprite Generation

1. **Background**: Always use "isolated on solid white background" or "solid green background" for easy removal
2. **Style Keywords**: Include "game asset", "2D sprite", "flat 2D", "orthographic view"
3. **Quality Tags**: Add "(gamedev)", "(game ready)", "clean edges", "no antialiasing artifacts"
4. **Avoid Text**: Include "no text, no labels, no watermarks" to prevent unwanted elements
5. **Consistency**: Use similar style descriptors across all prompts for cohesive art direction

## Art Style Direction

**Target Style**: Cute, colorful, arcade-style graphics with clean outlines
- Bright, saturated colors
- Soft gradients with clean edges
- Cartoonish proportions
- Friendly, approachable aesthetic
- Reminiscent of classic arcade games (Time Crisis meets Animal Crossing)

## POST-PROCESSING TIPS

After generating sprites with DALL-E:

1. **Remove Background**: Use remove.bg or Photoshop Magic Wand on white/green backgrounds
2. **Clean Edges**: Apply slight feathering or use Select & Mask for clean transparency
3. **Resize**: Scale to appropriate game dimensions (typically 64x64, 128x128, or 256x256)
4. **Optimize**: Save as PNG-8 for simple sprites, PNG-24 for gradients
5. **Create Atlas**: Combine related sprites into sprite sheets using TexturePacker or similar
6. **Consistency Check**: Ensure all sprites have similar line weights and color saturation
